# GenAI-for-Adaptive-Traffic-Flow-Optimization

Urban traffic congestion impacts productivity and sustainability. Create a generative AI solution that designs adaptive traffic management strategies to improve traffic flow. The system should generate real-time traffic signal timings, rerouting suggestions in existing navigation apps, or congestion mitigation plans based on inputs like vehicle density, road conditions, and historical patterns. The solution should produce actionable outputs, such as optimized signal schedules or driver notifications, to reduce delays and enhance road efficiency.
